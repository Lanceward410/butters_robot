# butters_robot
A wheeled robot named "Butters" equipped with LiDAR (ROS Foxy/Ubuntu 20)

Credits to Automatic Addison for one of the best repositories of ROS tutorials ever.

I used his tutorial found at https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-simulate-a-robot-using-gazebo-and-ros-2/ 
to create this robot, and I primarily used to test multi-robot communications with ROS 2 (Foxy) systems.
